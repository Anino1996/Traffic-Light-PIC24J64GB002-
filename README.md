# Traffic-Light-PIC24J64GB002-
Simple traffic management system that simulates traffic control at a crossroad using a PIC24J64GB002 microcontroller. Timer 2 interrupts and change notifications were used to initiate state changes. Change notifications employed in simulating changes in traffic light timer delay to exhibit a shorter delay during office hours and a longer delay during non-office hours. (hours of heavy traffic)
